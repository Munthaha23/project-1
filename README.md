**Project Title**
**Life Expectancy Analysis**

**About Dataset**
 Context
 Although there have been a lot of studies undertaken in the past on factors affecting
 life expectancy considering demographic variables, income composition and mortality
 rates. It was found that affect of immunization and human development index was not
 taken into account in the past. Also, some of the past research was done considering
 multiple linear regression based on a data set of one year for all the countries. Hence,
 this gives motivation to resolve both the factors stated previously by formulating a
regression model based on mixed effects model and multiple linear regression while
 considering data from a period of 2000 to 2015 for all the countries. Important
 immunization like Hepatitis B, Polio and Diphtheria will also be considered. In a
 nutshell, this study will focus on immunization factors, mortality factors, economic
 factors, social factors and other health related factors as well. Since the observations in
 this dataset are based on different countries, it will be easier for a country to determine
 the predicting factor which is contributing to lower value of life expectancy. This will
 help in suggesting a country which area should be given importance in order to
 efficiently improve the life expectancy of its population.
 
  **Step-by-Step Life Expectancy Analysis**
  
**1. Data Collection**

 For this analysis,  use a publicly available dataset. Let's use the "Life Expectancy
 Data" from the World Health Organization (WHO), which you can find on Kaggle or
 directly from WHO's repository.
 
 **2. Data Cleaning**
 
 clean the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and any anomalies.
 
 **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
 
  perform EDA to understand the distribution and relationships in the data.
  
 **4. Statistical Analysis and Visualization**
 
 conduct statistical tests and visualize the relationships between life expectancy
 and various economic indicators
